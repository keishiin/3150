In this practice, you will write a simple program that takes an integer from standard input and outputs its square and the two-times of this integer. 

The purpose of this practice is getting started on C++ header/source file structure, compiling and linking and standard I/O.

Check the provided started code for function signatures.

1. The first part is implementing two functions as specified in ECNumbers.h. Note (1): you need to declare the functions properly according to the description. 
Note (2): you need to properly write up the header file!

2. Once you complete the code in ECNumbers.h, create a namespace called ECNumbers and place the two functions you just implemented inside this namespace.

3. Now implement the (simple) function in ECCalculator.cpp

4. Now test the functions you just coded in TestNumbers.cpp. Here you would practice how to invoke functions when there is namespace

5. Now experiment to work with files in separate folders. Copy the header files you just created into the inc folder under SeparateFolder, and the source 
files under src folder. Now try to compile the code.

Programming practice: implement function
void ECRemoveSpace(int nums[], int let, int val) 
(from Leetcode)

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. 
More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
